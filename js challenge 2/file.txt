JavaScript Tasks

Using const instead of let helps keep variables from changing by mistake.
Arrays like inventory and words use const because their names stay the same, even if the items inside them change.
Numbers like sideA, sideB, and sideC also use const so they donâ€™t get changed by accident, making the code clearer and predictable.
